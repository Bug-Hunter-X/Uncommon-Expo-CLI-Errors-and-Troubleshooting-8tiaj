Solutions vary greatly depending on the specific error.  Here are some general troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify Package.json:** Ensure all dependencies and their versions are compatible.  Use `npm ls` or `yarn why <package-name>` to investigate dependency trees and potential conflicts.  Consider using a package manager lockfile (e.g., `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to maintain consistent dependency versions.

2. **Check app.json/eas.json:** Double-check for typos or incorrect settings in your configuration files.  Ensure that paths, versions, and other settings are accurate.  Pay attention to Android and iOS specific settings. 

3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes, cached files or leftover build artifacts can cause issues. Try running `expo prebuild --clean` followed by a clean build.  If using EAS Build, review the build logs for more clues.

4. **Examine Expo CLI Logs:**  Carefully read all Expo CLI output messages.  Errors and warnings usually provide valuable hints about the root cause. 

5. **Check for Peer Dependencies:**  Make sure all dependencies meet the peer dependency requirements. Use the package manager to identify the problem and then upgrade or downgrade the affected packages.  

6. **Environment Variables:**  Ensure your environment variables are correctly set.  Missing or incorrect environment variables might impact the build process. 

7. **Permissions:**  Check and adjust any necessary permissions, especially for file access or network communication.

8. **Expo SDK Version:**  Be sure that you are using the correct Expo SDK version and its compatibility with other used packages.

**Example Scenario (Dependency Conflict):**

Suppose you encounter an error like `Unmet peer dependency ...`. This typically points to a conflict between the versions of your dependencies.  Refer to the dependency tree (`npm ls` or `yarn why`) to identify conflicting packages.  Upgrade/downgrade as appropriate, ensuring all peerDependencies are met.

**Example Scenario (eas.json Misconfiguration):**

If you see errors related to EAS Build, carefully review your `eas.json` file.  Ensure all paths, build configurations, and credentials are correct.  Refer to the Expo EAS Build documentation for proper setup.

Remember to always consult the official Expo documentation and community forums for the most up-to-date solutions and guidance.
