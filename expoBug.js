This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  The exact error message might vary, but it typically involves issues with the project's configuration files (like `package.json`, `app.json`, or `eas.json`), or problems during the installation or update of dependencies.  One specific case is when a dependency has conflicting versions or unmet peerDependencies.  Another possibility involves incorrect configurations in the Expo managed workflow itself, such as issues with the `expo prebuild` command or `expo start` command failures due to incorrect environment variables or missing permissions.
